# Wedding Bells â€” Static Site

This is a small responsive static wedding site scaffold. It includes:

- Hero / cover section
- Bride & groom social links
- Integrated Google Maps embed for venue
- Event timeline
- Photo gallery with modal
- Bridesmaids / groomsmen section
- Love story
- Video section
- Event countdown
- Add to Google Calendar and .ics download
- Simple RSVP form (stores locally in localStorage)
- Gift registry links

How to preview locally:

Open `index.html` in your browser. For best results use a local server (recommended):

On Windows PowerShell, run:

```powershell
# from the project root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes:
- Replace placeholder images in `Images/` with your real photos.
- Update social links, map coordinates, and event datetime in `index.html` and `js/main.js`.
